# colony_war_game_java_edition
colony war game but written in java

This project is a reimplementation of an existing project, named X, which was originally written in the C language using a simulation approach based on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The Java edition of the project has been developed following the OOP principles. The transition from the functional programming style of the original project to the object-oriented programming style has facilitated a better understanding of OOP concepts. Competence in both C and Java languages has been acquired through this process.
